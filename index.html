        <h2 id="Aboutme"><em>About me</em></h2>
        <p>&nbsp;So who are you? You may ask.
            <br>
            I would first start with a basic and simple explanation. That I am 18 years old as of january 2025.
            Born and raised in Kenya. Went to a very prestigious school in highschool and now I am pursuing mathematics
            and computer science at Multimedia University Of Kenya.
            <br>
            &nbsp; At a deeper level though, I am a passionate person the fire in me to succed in life might just consume
            a whole forest.I dream to impact the human race to the best of my campability through tech and later in other aspects of life
            <br>
            One of my favourite quotes says; 
            <br>
            &nbsp;<em>To laugh often and much,To gain the respet of intelligent
            <br>
            people and the affection of children,to earn the appretiation of honest critics
            <br>
            and endure the the betrayal of false friends,to appreciate beauty,
            <br>
            and to leave the world a bit better,to know that even one life breathed easier beacause you lived.
            <br>
            This is to have succeeded.
            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;~Ralpho waldo emmerson.
                </em>
                <br>
            That is what I aim for that is what I live for.
